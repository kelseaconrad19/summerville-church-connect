Mission: We exist to glorify God by making disciples who love God, grow in community,
              and serve our city. Join us as we seek to share the transformative message of 
              Jesus Christ with our community and beyond.

Love God: We worship together and grow in our relationship with God through prayer, 
              Bible study, and fellowship.
